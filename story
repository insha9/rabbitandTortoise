Once upon a time there was a rabbit and tortoise. 
The rabbit wants to race tortoise to show other animals in the jungle how fast he is.
So he challenges the tortoise for a race.
they both stand at the starting point and the elephant makes a sound for tyhme to start.
they both start at the starting point and as soon as the elephant trumpets, the rabbit runs at his top speed
whereas teh tortoise moves in a slow pace.
the rabbit reaches under a tree and thinks to rest for a while as he was quite ahead
and he sleeps whereas the tortoise keeps moving at his pace.
